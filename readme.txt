Now, I implemented both access and refresh tokens with key rotation.
Access tokens being sent as secure cookies and get revoked and to a token blacklist in
the mongo  Atlas.
Refresh tokens being encrypted and saved as a property in the user schema.

I've got some things I gotta check :
    -The key rotation ensures that the tokens are valid until they expire even when the 
    keys are rotated.
    -The refresh token blacklist should be verified every authentication.


----------------------------------------------
Here are a few additional things you can check to ensure your authentication system is robust:

Token expiration:

Verify that access tokens and refresh tokens have appropriate expiration times. Access tokens 
should have a shorter expiration time (e.g., minutes) to enforce regular re-authentication, while 
refresh tokens can have a longer expiration time (e.g., days) for extended sessions.

Token revocation: 

Confirm that both access tokens and refresh tokens are properly revoked and 
invalidated when users log out or when they are added to the token blacklist. Test the token 
revocation process thoroughly to ensure that revoked tokens are no longer accepted.

Token validation and verification: 

Make sure that each request requiring authentication 
verifies the access token's validity. Validate the token signature, expiration, and blacklist 
status before granting access to protected resources.

Token renewal and refreshing: 

Implement a mechanism to automatically renew access tokens using 
refresh tokens when they expire. Verify that the token renewal process works smoothly and that 
expired access tokens can be successfully refreshed.

Error handling and logging: 

Check that your authentication system handles and logs errors 
appropriately. Ensure that error messages do not leak sensitive information and that proper 
error responses are sent to the client in case of authentication failures.

Security best practices: 

Review your code and implementation to ensure adherence to security 
best practices. This includes securely storing sensitive information such as encryption keys 
and secret tokens, protecting against common web vulnerabilities (e.g., cross-site scripting 
and cross-site request forgery), and enforcing secure communication (e.g., HTTPS).

Stress and vulnerability testing: 

Perform stress testing and vulnerability assessments on your 
authentication system to identify any potential weaknesses or vulnerabilities. Use tools and 
techniques to simulate high loads, security attacks, and edge cases to ensure your system can 
handle them gracefully.

Remember to follow secure coding practices, keep your dependencies up to date, and regularly 
review and audit your authentication system for any security improvements.
